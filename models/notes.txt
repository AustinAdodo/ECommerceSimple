1. The let keyword has block scope. This means that it can only be accessed from within the block of code in which it is declared.

2. The this keyword can be changed using the bind() method. It can also refer to different objects depending on how the function is called.

3. The result of the code snippet const x = 5; const y = "10"; console.log(x + y); is "510". 
This is because JavaScript automatically converts numbers to strings when they are added to strings.

4. All of the statements about prototype inheritance in JavaScript are true. Every object has a prototype, except for the base object. 
Prototypes can be modified at runtime. Object properties are stored in their prototype objects. Prototypes form a tree-like structure.

5. All of the methods listed are ways to prevent modifications to an object in JavaScript.

6. The output of the code snippet function Animal(name) { this.name = name; } Animal.prototype.walk = function() { console.log(${this.name} 
is walking.); }; function Dog(name) { Animal.call(this, name); } Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype); 
const myDog = new Dog('Rover'); myDog.walk(); is "Rover is walking."

7. The output of the code snippet var a = 1; function foo() { console.log(a); var a = 2; } foo(); is 1. 
This is because JavaScript functions have their own scope, and the var keyword declares variables 
within the scope in which they are declared.

8. All of the statements about arrow functions are true. Arrow functions have their own this context, they can be used as constructors, 
they can have their own prototype, and they can have a variable number of arguments.

9.The output of the code snippet const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, greet() { console.log(Hi, my name is ${this.name} and 
I'm ${this.age} years old.); } }; 
const greet = person.greet; greet(); is "Hi, my name is John and I'm 30 years old." 
This is because the greet() function is a closure, and it has access to the variables in the scope in which it was created, 
even after that scope has closed.

10. All of the statements about closures in JavaScript are true. Closures allow a function to access variables from its parent scope, 
they can be created without using the new keyword, they can be used with arrow functions, and they can be created outside of a class.

11. The output of the code snippet const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => { resolve('Promise 1'); }, 1000); });
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => { reject('Promise 2 Error'); }, 500); });
Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then((result) => { console.log(result); }).catch((error) => { console.log(error); }); is "Promise 2 Error".
This is because the Promise.race() method will resolve to the first promise that resolves or rejects. In this case, the second 
promise will reject first, so the Promise.race() method will reject with the same error.

12. The output of the code snippet const promise1 = Promise.reject('Promise 1 Error'); 
const promise2 = Promise.resolve('Promise 2'); Promise.any([promise1, promise2])
.then((result) => { console.log(result); }).catch((error) => { console.log(error); }); is "Promise 2". 
This is because the Promise.any() method will resolve to the first promise that resolves, or reject with an error 
if all of the promises reject. In this case, the second promise will resolve first, so the Promise.any() method 
will resolve to the same value.
